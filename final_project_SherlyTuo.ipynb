        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the [Global Gender Gap Report](\"https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-gender-gap-report-2025/\") released by the World Economic Forum (2025), China ranks 103rd worldwide in terms of the gender gap. China’s relatively low position in gender-gap rankings can be observed across various aspects of social life (Wang et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "Meanwhile, feminism in China has been developing amid various tensions. An increasing number of females have begun to speak openly about gender issues (Hou, 2021), which has sparked wide public debate. Much of this debate is reflected on social media. Piao et al. (2025) find, through their analysis of major short-video platforms in China, that public opinions toward feminism have become markedly polarized. Such polarization not only reflects societal divisions but also further shapes the discursive environment surrounding gender issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "This complex environment reflects the potential for policy change. Kingdon (1995) proposed the policy-window framework, which argues that policy change does not occur at any moment; rather, it requires the convergence of three “streams” at a particular point in time to open a policy window. These streams are:\n",
        "*   Problem Stream. This refers to the emergence of certain social issues that draw public attention.\n",
        "*   Policy Stream. This refers to scholars, experts, and government actors proposing various solutions, which are then discussed and filtered.\n",
        "*   Politics Stream. This refers to the level of attention and support that policy decision-makers give to the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of gender issues, the polarized discourse in the media reflects the dynamics of the “problem stream,” as public debates surrounding feminism have heightened the visibility of these concerns. **This project, however, approaches the issue from the perspective of the “political stream,” using Chinese News Headlines as an analytical entry point to examine how the media present and construct gender-related topics, thereby offering potential insights for future policymaking.**\n",

        "## 3. Research Method\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Collection: Because major Chinese news websites have high access restrictions and I could not find a platform similar to NewsAPI. Therefore I used [TianAPI](\"https://www.tianapi.com/\"), which is a well-known API provider in China. I selected its [“social news”](\"https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/3\") section to collect news articles (the link is to the documentation).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Cleaning: During the scraping &fetching process, the same news headline could appear with multiple keywords, so I removed duplicate news headlines when creating the df_all dataset. After collecting the data, I renamed the columns to make them clearer, converted them into the correct data types, removed missing values, and cleaned extra blank spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Sentiment Analysis: The Baidu Sentiment Analysis API is a cloud-based tool that provides sentiment classification for Chinese text. After creating an application on Baidu AI Cloud, the platform provides an API Key, and Secret Key, which allow users to send text to the API and receive sentiment scores(with free limited access). The reasons for choosing this will be discussed in a later section.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Data Visualization: I used plotly.express as my visualization tool.\n"

        "The chart shows clear differences across topics in how often gender is mentioned in news headlines. For fraud, most headlines are unmarked, with only a few referring to either men or women. This suggests that gender is generally not a focus in fraud-related reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "For gender-based violence, there is a much higher number of M-marked and especially Both cases. The large count of Both is not surprising, as these stories often involve conflicts between two people, making it more likely for headlines to mention both genders.\n",
        "\n",
        "In traffic incidents, almost all headlines are unmarked, and only a handful include any gender terms. This fits expectations—traffic news usually focuses on the accident itself rather than the gender of the individuals involved.\n",
        "\n",
        "For violent crime, the number of F-marked headlines is noticeably higher compared to other topics, although unmarked still makes up the largest group. This may indicate that in certain violent events, the gender of the victim or the person involved—especially if female—is more often highlighted.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the figure suggests that the likelihood of gender being marked depends heavily on the type of news topic. Gender-based violence and violent crime tend to include gender terms more frequently, while fraud and traffic incidents rarely do. This provides useful context for the upcoming sentiment analysis, especially regarding whether headlines mentioning women are more negatively framed."

Overall, F-marked headlines have the lowest average sentiment, meaning that headlines mentioning women tend to carry more negative tone compared with the other categories.

        "For gender-based violence, the three categories show similar sentiment levels, though F-marked and M-marked headlines are slightly higher than Both.

        "This project has several limitations. First, the data comes from a single API, so the headlines may not fully represent all Chinese news sources. Second, the topic categories are based on predefined keywords, which means some headlines may be misclassified. Third, the gender labels rely on explicit gender terms, so more subtle forms of gender reference cannot be captured. Fourth, although Baidu’s sentiment model worked best for my tests, it may still miss nuances in news language. Finally, the analysis is based only on headlines, which might not reflect the tone of the full articles.\n"

        "\n",
        "This project examined how gender appears in Chinese news headlines and whether women are described more negatively. The results offer partial support for both hypotheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "For H1, headlines were more likely to mention gender when the subject was female, especially in topics like gender-based violence and violent crime, while male marking appeared less often.\n",
        "\n",
        "For H2, sentiment analysis showed that headlines referring to women tended to have slightly more negative sentiment than those referring to men. The differences are not large, but the pattern is consistent across topics, suggesting that gender marking—especially for women—is tied to more negative framing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the findings show that gender continues to influence how news is written. Although the dataset is limited, the patterns suggest directions for future research with larger and more diverse data."
